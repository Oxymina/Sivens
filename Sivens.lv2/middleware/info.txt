Very simple
in code add this

export default {
  middleware: 'WHAT AUTH YOU WANT',
}

and boom, site is auth protected by user role

4 types of auth

guest - no-login, nothing needed
auth - logged in user with a valid token
writer - logged in user with a valid token and role 2 ( writer )
admin - logged in user with a valdi token and role 3 ( admin )
